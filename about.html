		<h1>About our Club</h1>
			<p class="quote">&quot;The ISSC is committed to encouraging all to play and enjoy the Gaelic Games no matter their ability, in an atmosphere that promotes fun, friendship and personal growth.&quot;</p>
			<p>The Irish Sporting and Social Club was formed in 1974 with the aim of bringing the local Irish community together socially and to promote the games of Gaelic Football, Hurling and Camogie.</p>
			<p>Today, the GAA club is a blend of Irish immigrants, second generation Irish descendants, Canadians and other nationalities.</p>
			<p>The club runs a number of successful teams including the Vancouver Harps and Vancouver Celts Men's and Ladies Gaelic Football Teams and the JP Ryan's Hurling and Camogie teams.</p>
			<p>The ISSC continues to promote and support Irish cultural and sporting events in Greater Vancouver, and are always welcoming new members.</p>				
			<p>Last year, ISSC Vancouver celebrated 40 years and plans are set for continued growth in the future. To find out more about the ISSC Club Development please click here: ISSC Club Development Plan (Nov2014)</p>
