		<h1>Ladies Football</h1>
			<p>Ladies Gaelic Football in Vancouver was established in the 1980's. Today, we have two Ladies Football teams, the Vancouver Harps and the Vancouver Celts.</p>
			<p>The Ladies Football teams have participated in various tournaments over the years - the Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Seattle annual tournaments, the Western Canadian Championships, the Smithwicks Sevens Tournament in San Francisco and the North American Championships.</p>
			<p>Ladies football in Vancouver is going from strength to strength with the numbers growing every year. We welcome players of all nationalities and have had Irish immigrants, second generation Irish, Canadians, English, Scottish, Australians, New Zealanders and Americans amongst others playing football with us.</p>
			<p>The influx of immigrants over the past few years has greatly helped put ladies football in Vancouver on the GAA map. Over the past five years, the ladies have won the Western Canadian Championships four times and have won the Vancouver and Seattle tournaments on numerous occasions. 2011 was the first year the Vancouver Ladies Football entered a team to compete in the North American Championships. That Vancouver team was crowned winners of the Intermediate Shield, beating fellow countrywomen St. Mikes of Toronto in that final.</p>
			<p>This year promises to be a very successful year for ladies football in Vancouver and we encourage all players, both experienced and beginners to dust off your boots and come out to play.</p>				
			<p>If you are interested in playing Ladies Gaelic Football, please send an <a href="mailto:ladiesfootball@isscvancouver.com" class="email">email</a> and one of our representatives will get back to you as soon as possible with details of training times, locations and tournament information.</p>
